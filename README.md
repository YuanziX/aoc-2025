My (probably vastly inefficient) solutions for Advent Of Code 2025.

This time will be my year, we completing it whole this time (only 12 in total).

Coded in go, if you have any suggestions feel free to create a PR. I just solve them for fun.

If you don't know what AOC is, here you go, [check it out](https://adventofcode.com/), pretty fun problems there.
